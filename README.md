# Social Network Graph Project

## Overview

This Java-based project focuses on analyzing social networks using graph data structures. It includes implementations of graph algorithms for identifying influential nodes and analyzing information spread. The project aims to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of graph-based solutions compared to other data structures.

## Features

- Graph data structure implementation using adjacency list representation
- Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm for identifying influential nodes
- Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm for analyzing information spread
- Unit tests and performance tests to validate correctness and efficiency
- Use case examples for practical applications
- Optimization opportunities for further enhancement

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/social-network-graph-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd social-network-graph-project
   ```

3. Compile the Java files:

   ```bash
   javac *.java
   ```

4. Run the main class:

   ```bash
   java Main
   ```

5. Follow the prompts to interact with the social network graph and perform analyses.
